<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Everything was fine with the project. During the execution of the flask code<br>I have solved some issues regarding the installation of python packages such as<br>flask, gunicorn etc which I have installed using pip.&nbsp;This project also taught me<br>about the deployment of flask code into the user-friendly heroku platform.During the deployment<br>process, I have come across few issues in the code and I have<br>fixed them by checking the logs of heroku.&nbsp;I have also learnt to use<br>the git to push the files into my git account.<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> What can you tell me about docker? Describe the various steps needed to get an app ran inside a docker container in your own words</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>Docker is a tool that allows developers to create, deploy, and run applications<br>in containers. Docker containers are lightweight tools that contain everything needed to run<br>an application, including code, libraries, and system tools.</div><div><br></div><div>Here are the step by step<br>procedures to run an app in a Docker&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Create a Dockerfile</b>: A Dockerfile is<br>a configuration file that describes the environment and dependencies needed to run the<br>application inside a container.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Build a Docker image</b>: After the creation of Dockerfile, we<br>can use the Docker command line tool to build a Docker image. This<br>process involves running the Dockerfile instructions to create a new image that can<br>be used to run our application.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Start a Docker container</b>: After Docker image, we<br>can start a Docker container from that image. This involves using the "docker<br>run" command to start a new container based on the image we created<br>in the previous step.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Test the application</b>: Once you have started a Docker container,<br>we can test our application by accessing it using the URL. we can<br>also use the "docker exec" command to run commands inside the container to<br>test the application.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Deploy the container</b>: After we have tested our application, we can<br>deploy our Docker container to a production environment. This can be done by<br>pushing the Docker image to a registry or repository</div><div><br></div><div>Here are the links which<br>I have used to learn about Docker<br></div><div><br></div><div><b><a href="https://docs.docker.com/language/python/build-images/">https://docs.docker.com/language/python/build-images/</a></b><br></div><div>https://docs.docker.com/language/python/run-containers/<br></div><div>https://docs.docker.com/language/python/deploy/<br></div><div><br></div><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> What is Heroku? Why do you feel it was chosen for this class?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>Heroku is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) that allows developers to<br>deploy, run, and manage applications in the cloud. Heroku provides a simple and<br>intuitive way to deploy web applications without having to worry about the underlying<br>infrastructure.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The reasons for choosing Heroku for this class are:</div><div><br></div><div><b>Ease of use</b>: Heroku is<br>designed to be easy to use and deploy applications quickly. It provides a<br>simple user interface and command-line tools that allow developers to deploy their applications<br>in minutes.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Flexibility</b>: Heroku supports a wide range of programming languages and frameworks. In<br>the above project, Python was used to run the program&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Cost-effectiveness:</b> Heroku allows developers<br>to deploy and run small applications at a least cost. This makes it<br>a good choice for this class.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Integration with other tools</b>: Heroku integrates with popular<br>development tools like GitHub and Slack, making it easy to set up continuous<br>integration and deployment pipelines.</div><div><br></div><div>Here are the reference links from where I have learnt<br>about heroku</div><div><br></div><div><a href="https://mentormate.com/blog/what-is-heroku-used-for-cloud-development/">https://mentormate.com/blog/what-is-heroku-used-for-cloud-development/</a><br></div><div>https://www.heroku.com/dx<br></div><div>https://www.heroku.com/what#heroku-and-salesforce<br></div><div><br></div><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> What is flask? List a few things you learned about it</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>Flask is a popular Python web framework that allows developers to build web<br>applications quickly and easily. It provides a lightweight and flexible approach to web<br>development, allowing developers to focus on writing application logic.</div><div><br></div><div>Here are a few things<br>I learned about Flask:</div><div><br></div><div><div><b>Web Development</b>: Flask can be used for web development and<br>creation of web applications using Python. It provides an easy-to-learn approach</div><div><br></div><div><b>Routing</b>: Flask uses<br>a routing system to map URLs to functions. This makes it easy to<br>create complex web applications with many pages</div><div><br></div><div><b>Database Interaction</b>: Flask integrates easily with various<br>databases, such as SQLite, MySQL. It can be used to interact with databases<br>using Python and handling database queries and updates.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Deployment</b>: Flask can be deployed on<br>various platforms, including cloud platforms like Heroku and AWS.&nbsp;</div></div><div><br></div><div>The resources I have referred<br>to are given below</div><div><br></div><div><a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/">https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/</a><br></div><div>https://pythonbasics.org/what-is-flask-python/<br></div><div>https://www.tutorialspoint.com/flask/flask_environment.htm<br></div><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 4: </em> What is the difference between a Dockerfile and a Github Action .yml file?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>Purpose: A Dockerfile is used to define the instructions for building a Docker<br>image, while a Github Action .yml file is used to define workflows and<br>automate tasks in a Github repository.</div><div><br></div><div>Content: A Dockerfile contains the instructions for building<br>a Docker image, including the base image, dependencies, and configurations. On the other<br>hand, a Github Action .yml file contains the configuration for running workflows, including<br>the trigger events, jobs, and steps.</div><div><br></div><div>Scope: A Dockerfile is specific to the Docker<br>image being built, while a Github Action .yml file is specific to the<br>repository in which it is defined.</div><div><br></div><div>Build vs. Deployment: A Dockerfile is used to<br>build Docker images that can be deployed to various environments, while a Github<br>Action .yml file is used to automate tasks related to code testing, building,<br>and deployment within a Github repository.</div><div><br></div><div>Integration: Dockerfiles can be integrated with continuous integration<br>and continuous deployment (CI/CD) tools to automate the Docker image building process. Github<br>Actions can also be integrated with various CI/CD tools, but they are primarily<br>used within the Github ecosystem.</div><br></td></tr>
